## Installation

### Install node.js on your Raspberry PI

Download and compile the latest version of node.js:

````bash
$ wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.19/node-v0.8.19.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf node-v0.8.19.tar.gz
$ cd node-v0.8.19/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
````

#### Install rasp2c module

To install the rasp2c module, change in your project directory and type: 

````bash
$ npm install rasp2c
````

### Prepare the Raspberry PI for I2C communication

#### Activate I2C kernel module

Edit the file `/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf`

````bash
$ sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
````

Search for the row

````
blacklist i2c-bcm2708
````

and comment it
````
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708
````

Leave the editor (with `:wq!`)

#### Load I2C kernel modules

Load the required kernel modules

````bash
$ modprobe i2c-bcm2708
$ modprobe i2c_dev
````

Use `lsmod` to check, if the modules are loaded.

````bash
$ lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
nfsd                  236425  11
i2c_dev                 5587  20
i2c_bcm2708             3542  0
snd_bcm2835            19889  0
snd_pcm                74834  1 snd_bcm2835
snd_seq                52536  0
snd_timer              19698  2 snd_seq,snd_pcm
snd_seq_device          6300  1 snd_seq
snd                    52489  5 snd_seq_device,snd_timer,snd_seq,snd_pcm,snd_bcm2835
snd_page_alloc          4951  1 snd_pcm
````

To load the modules automatically on boot, you can add them to the `/etc/modules` file.

````bash
$ sudo vi /etc/modules

snd_bcm2835
i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev
````

#### Install I2C tools

Install the i2c-tools

````bash
$ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
````

Add your user to the i2c usergroup so you don't need to use sudo to interact with the i2c device.

````bash
$ sudo usermod -aG i2c pi
````

## Usage

An example application can be found here: https://github.com/ni-c/node-rasp2c-example

````js
var rasp2c = require('rasp2c');

// Detect devices on the I2C Bus
rasp2c.detect(function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(result);
  }
});

// Dump the addresses 0x11 - 0x15 of the I2C device at address 0xa1 on the I2C bus
rasp2c.dump('0xa1', '0x11-0x15', function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(result);
  }
});

// Set the address 0x11 of the I2C device at address 0xa1 on the I2C bus to 0xff
rasp2c.set('0xa1', '0x11', '0xff', function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(result);
  }
});
